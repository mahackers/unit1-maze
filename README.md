# unit1-maze

Your goal is to write a Karel program that can successfully navigate a maze.

The end of the maze is where the beeper is located.

Feel free to ask us for help if you run into trouble, but try to do as much
as you can on your own. Look back to your previous Karel programs and at the
Karel reference card for help.
